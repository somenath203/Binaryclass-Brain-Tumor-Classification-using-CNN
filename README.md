# Brain Tumor Classification using CNN

This is a project which uses Tensorflow, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Streamlit to analyze MRI images of Brain and detect the presence or absence of Tumors.

## Dataset used in this project

## Warning

While this model is able to classify brain tumors correctly, but in some cases, the model may misclassify tumors or fail to detect them altogether, therefore, it is strongly advised not to rely solely on the output of this model.
